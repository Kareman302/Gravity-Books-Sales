This project aims to design and implement a Data Warehouse (DWH) solution for GravityBooks, an Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) database.
The OLTP database contains data related to Customers, Addresses, Books, Authors, and Shipping methods. 
The Data Warehouse is built using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for ETL processes, Snowflake schema for data modeling, and SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) for analysis. 
Additionally, a dashboard is developed to visualize key metrics and relationships within the data.
